# The-Perfect-Guess---Python
A program that generates a random number and asks the user to guess
it. If the player guesses a higher number, then the program displays
"lower number please". 
Similarly,  if the user guesses a lower number, then the program
displays "higher number please".
When the user guesses the correct number, the program displays the
number of guesses the user took to arrive at the number.
